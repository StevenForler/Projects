// this is how you make a comment. it is a single line comment

// this is how you get any information from JavaScript that you can use to help debug your code basically JS equivalent to print()
console.log('hello world') 
// Also the Console log is really picky about having a comment next to it so running the log won't produce anything
console.log(4) 
console.log(4 + 4) 
// to add an apostrophe in a string you can use \' to help ignore it so it doesn't break the full string weirdly
console.log('I don\'t like how javascript works') 
// values are what data type something is. for example. strings are just sentences and integer are just whole numbers and there are more like that
