# Todo list rough plan
This will be going over what videos and what elements from those videos do I want to implement in my todo list. There will be a base follow along video that I will do to get things started with. Then start hunting for supplemental elements to turn my todo list into the ultimate user experience.

### Expectations
* This application is only going to have barebone features
1. add an item (user input)
2. edit item (if mistake was made or task wasn't originally clear)
3. local storage (to remember item and changes)
4. filter items (all, complete, unfinished)
5. delete

### Goal
* This app will be used as a user experience study
* Find and implement elements to my app to make users enjoy using it.
* To have the UI has Mobile Friendly as possible (streamlined)

    - [x] Delete filter to clean up the look of the page
    - [ ] Make it add new list items at the top of the list every time

    - [ ] Adjust the list item to be curved
    - [ ] Remove black border when user is typing in the input field
    - [ ] Change the opacity to the placeholder text in CSS
    - [x] Insert a placeholder text that says "Add a Task" in the user input video [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0jO8kUrg-I)

## Ideas
 for this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eFwtaZf6zc) There's a place where you can add your name.<br> I want that name to also get added to the tab. For example:<br> The tab will just say "To-do list" but as the user starts writing their name it will also appear in the tab as "Steven's To-do list".<br> probably something I will have to look into a small end detail.
