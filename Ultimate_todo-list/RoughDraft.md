# Todo list rough plan
This will be going over what videos and what elements from those videos do I want to implement in my todo list. There will be a base follow along video that I will do to get things started with. Then start hunting for supplemental elements to turn my todo list into the ultimate user experience.

### Expectations
* This application is only going to have barebone features
1. add an item (user input)
2. edit item (if mistake was made or task wasn't originally clear)
3. local storage (to remember item and changes)
4. filter items (all, complete, unfinished)
5. delete

### Goal
* This app will be used as a user experience study
* Find and implement elements to my app to make users enjoy using it.
* To have the UI has Mobile Friendly as possible (streamlined)

## video references
* The main follow along [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-N_w0Op84)
    
* Things I want to add and adjust to the base
    - [ ] Move filter to be on its own line and with the background as well.
    - [ ] make sure to add the delete animation as an entrance animation
    - [ ] For task deletion animations use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ)
    - [ ] add text within the input box that says "add your task" video [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0jO8kUrg-I)
    - [ ] At a username input at the top. Video [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eFwtaZf6zc)
* For box shadows use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB2TZco4i84)
    - [ ] Have a background for the To-do list ( could be white or something)

## Ideas
 for this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eFwtaZf6zc) There's a place where you can add your name.<br> I want that name to also get added to the tab. For example:<br> The tab will just say "To-do list" but as the user starts writing their name it will also appear in the tab as "Steven's To-do list".<br> probably something I will have to look into a small end detail.
